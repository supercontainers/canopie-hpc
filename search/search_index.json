This revolution has established a new ecosystem of tools and techniques with new, flexible and agile approaches, and continues to gain traction in the HPC community.  In addition to HPC-optimized container runtimes, emerging technologies like  Kubernetes create a new set of opportunities and challenges.  While adoption is growing, questions regarding best practices, foundational concepts, tools, and standards remain.</p> <p>Our goal is to promote the adoption of these tools and introspect the impact of this new ecosystem on HPC use cases. This workshop serves as a key venue for presenting late-breaking research, sharing experiences and best practices, and fostering collaboration in this field. Our seventh workshop iteration will continue to emphasize real-world experiences and challenges in adopting and optimizing these new approaches for HPC.</p>"},{"location":"cfp/#scope","title":"Scope","text":"<p>The scope of this workshop is to better understand and improve paradigms around containerization, virtualization and orchestration for HPC use cases.

We have made adjustments to the format for SC25 to include more dynamic and engaging content, in addition to the traditional full paper presentations. The content of technical sessions will be driven by the mix of accepted submissions curated by the program chairs. We will offer two submission tracks: one for full paper submissions, and one for lightning talks. Like the previous edition, CANOPIE-HPC SC25 is going to be a full day workshop. </p> <p>Full paper submissions will receive at least 3 peer reviews in the SC25  submission system on the basis of scientific validity, impact to the field, reproducibility, and opportunity for interactive discussion at the workshop. The program committee will discuss the submissions and their reviews over a conference call moderated by the program chairs; final proceedings will be selected by majority vote of the committee. As in all previous years, accepted paper submissions will be published by the SC proceedings publisher, which for SC25 is ACM. Artifacts for reproducibility (digital archives of code,  README instructions, images, etc.) will be a significant factor in paper  acceptance into the workshop. Further details are available in the  \"Submission procedure\" section below.</p> <p>For lightning talks, participants can submit an abstract and an extended  abstract that will be reviewed by the program committee. Our lightning talk  track is meant to showcase demos, exploratory and late-breaking work,  pain-points or shortcomings in current container/virtualization technologies,  and projects that may not be fleshed-out enough to warrant a paper submission.  We especially encourage lightning talk submissions from early career participants and people who are relatively new to the world of containers/virtualization.</p>"},{"location":"cfp/#diversity-and-inclusivity","title":"Diversity and inclusivity","text":"<p>Similarly to the broader field of HPC, the organizers recognize concerns with  diversity and inclusion for CANOPIE-HPC. We continuously work to improve  diversity and inclusion at leadership, program committee, and participation levels.  We plan early and often targeted recruiting and advice-seeking with diversity  organizations (e.g., WHPC). CANOPIE-HPC states explicit inclusion goals in the  workshop CFP, includes an optional inclusion plan in paper submission system, and specially considers any submitted inclusion plans during the Program  Committee meeting.  To open CANOPIE-HPC to more early-career and non-expert participants,  we plan to offer an expanded lightning talks session to lower the barrier to entry  in the workshop. The workshop organizers will make any space considerations  necessary to include those with accessibility requirements and ensure  wheelchair-designated seating remains available to those in need. We also plan to  include a 30 minute open discussion section to invite additional audience questions  and participation. Furthermore, we will encourage attendees to join the Slack  channel hpc-containers to have an opportunity to continue to chat, ask questions  and make professional connections.</p>"},{"location":"cfp/#reproducibility-plan","title":"Reproducibility plan","text":"<p>In conjunction with the SC Reproducibility Initiative, paper submissions are required  to provide artifact descriptions as submission appendices, if applicable.

With its increasing popularity, users have started porting batch and HPC workloads onto Kubernetes, encountering some challenges. In this talk I will discuss the recent improvements we have done to the Job API to enable more batch and HPC workloads to run on Kubernetes and our collaboration with Kubeflow to enable MPI workloads at scale. Bio: Aldo is a Software Developer at Google Kubernetes Engine. He is a top contributor to the Kubernetes project, focusing primarily on kube-scheduler and the Job controller. He recently became a TL for Kubernetes SIG Scheduling. 10:00 am SC21 scheduled Morning Coffee Break 10:30 am Momme Allalen, David Brayford, John Brennan, Kenneth Hanley, Luigi Iapichino, Niall Moran, Lee James O\u2019Riordan, \u201cDeploying Containerized QuantEX Quantum Simulation Software on HPC Systems\u201c 11:00 am Claudia Misale, Maurizio Drocco, Daniel Milroy, Carlos Eduardo Arango Gutierrez, Stephen Herbein, Dong Ahn, Yoonho Park, \u201cIt\u2019s a Scheduling Affair: GROMACS in the Cloud with the KubeFlux Scheduler\u201c 11:30 am Lightning Talks Liliane Neves de Oliveira Kunstmann, \u201cProvDeploy: A containerized provenance service towards reproducibility in DL workflows\u201d Abdulrahman Azab, \u201cAnalyzing Unikernel Support for HPC: Experimental Study of OpenMP\u201d Quincy Wofford, \u201cProvenance or Portability (Can we have both?)\u201d 11:50 pm Jeremy Fischer, Mike Low, David Hancock, \u201cJetstream 2.0\u201d 12:30 pm SC21 scheduled Lunch Break 2:00 pm Yan-Tyng (Sherry) Chang, Steve Heistand, Robert Hood, Henry Jin, \u201cFeasibility of Running Singularity Containers with Hybrid MPI on NASA High-End Computing Resources\u201d 2:30 pm Gregory J.

What would the next generation architecture look like? How do we leverage containers to do computing of complex workflows while orchestrating not only jobs, but data? How do we bridge HPC into the 2020\u2019s and make optimal use of multi-clusters and federate these systems into a larger resource to unite onprem, multi-prem, cloud, and multi-cloud? How do we integrate with these resources in a cloud-native compatible manner supporting CI/CD, DevOps, DevSecOps, compute portals, GUIs, and even mobile? This isn\u2019t a bunch of shoelace and duct-tape on top of legacy HPC, this is an entirely new way to think about HPC infrastructure.

The objective of this workshop is to serve as the principal venue for leaders in the field to stimulate research and interactions in relation to cutting-edge container technologies, virtualization, and OS system software as it relates to supporting High Performance Computing (HPC). The first iteration of this workshop will give special attention to work which can provide real-world experiences to containerization in HPC, as well as promote the use of containers and engage in a collaborative manner with the larger HPC community.</p> <p>Container computing has revolutionized the way groups are developing, sharing, and running software and services.  This has initially been led by growth with Docker, which has provided an ecosystem of tools to enable container based computing.  This paradigm shift has since made in-roads in the HPC community enabled by container runtimes like Singularity, Shifter, and Charliecloud, which allow end-users to run containers in environments where standard Docker tools would not be feasible.  Orchestration systems such as Kubernetes allow for quick, scalable service deployments in conjunction with HPC. While this adoption is growing, the larger HPC community still has many questions around this new model. There still exist several undefined research questions related to containerization in HPC that the community must address.  </p>"},{"location":"prev/2023/organizers/","title":"Organizers","text":""},{"location":"prev/2023/organizers/#steering-committee","title":"STEERING COMMITTEE","text":"<ul> <li>Shane Canon \u2013 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</li> <li>Andrew Younge \u2013 Sandia National Laboratories</li> </ul>"},{"location":"prev/2023/organizers/#program-chairs","title":"PROGRAM CHAIRS","text":"<ul> <li>Alberto Madonna, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre</li> <li>Laurie Stephey, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab</li> </ul>"},{"location":"prev/2023/organizers/#technical-program-committee","title":"TECHNICAL PROGRAM COMMITTEE","text":"<ul> <li>Subil Abraham, Oak Ridge National Laboratory</li> <li>Carlos Eduardo Arango Gutierrez, NVIDIA Corporation</li> <li>Abdulrahman Azab, University of Oslo; PRACE</li> <li>Carlos Jaime Barrios Hernandez, SCALAC, Industrial University of Santander (Colombia)</li> <li>David Brayford, HPE</li> <li>Patrick Bridges, University of New Mexico</li> <li>Taylor Childers, Argonne National Laboratory</li> <li>Felipe A.

We continuously work to improve  diversity and inclusion at leadership, program committee, and participation levels.  We plan early and often targeted recruiting and advice-seeking with diversity  organizations (e.g., WHPC). CANOPIE-HPC states explicit inclusion goals in the  workshop CFP, includes an optional inclusion plan in paper submission system, and specially considers any submitted inclusion plans during the Program  Committee meeting.  To open CANOPIE-HPC to more early-career and non-expert participants,  we plan to offer an expanded lightning talks session to lower the barrier to entry  in the workshop. The workshop organizers will make any space considerations  necessary to include those with accessibility requirements and ensure  wheelchair-designated seating remains available to those in need. We also plan to  include a 30 minute open discussion section to invite additional audience questions  and participation. Furthermore, we will encourage attendees to join the Slack  channel hpc-containers to have an opportunity to continue to chat, ask questions  and make professional connections.</p>"},{"location":"prev/2024/cfp/#reproducibility-plan","title":"Reproducibility plan","text":"<p>In conjunction with the SC Reproducibility Initiative, submissions are required  to provide artifact descriptions as submission appendices, if applicable.

The objective of this workshop is to serve as the principal venue for leaders in the field to stimulate research and interactions in relation to cutting-edge container technologies, virtualization, and OS system software as it relates to supporting High Performance Computing (HPC). The first iteration of this workshop will give special attention to work which can provide real-world experiences to containerization in HPC, as well as promote the use of containers and engage in a collaborative manner with the larger HPC community.</p> <p>Container computing has revolutionized the way groups are developing, sharing, and running software and services.  This has initially been led by growth with Docker, which has provided an ecosystem of tools to enable container based computing.  This paradigm shift has since made in-roads in the HPC community enabled by container runtimes like Singularity, Shifter, and Charliecloud, which allow end-users to run containers in environments where standard Docker tools would not be feasible.  Orchestration systems such as Kubernetes allow for quick, scalable service deployments in conjunction with HPC. While this adoption is growing, the larger HPC community still has many questions around this new model. There still exist several undefined research questions related to containerization in HPC that the community must address.  </p>"},{"location":"prev/2024/organizers/","title":"Organizers","text":""},{"location":"prev/2024/organizers/#steering-committee","title":"STEERING COMMITTEE","text":"<ul> <li>Shane Canon \u2013 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</li> <li>Andrew Younge \u2013 Sandia National Laboratories</li> </ul>"},{"location":"prev/2024/organizers/#program-chairs","title":"PROGRAM CHAIRS","text":"<ul> <li>Alberto Madonna, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre</li> <li>Claudia Misale, IBM T.J.
